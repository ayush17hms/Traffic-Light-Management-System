# IoT-Based Traffic Light Management System

## Introduction
This project is an IoT-based Traffic Light Management System designed to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion by implementing a smart, automated system. Using IoT technology, the system adjusts traffic light timings based on real-time vehicle density.

## Features
- **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring:** Uses sensors to detect vehicle density and adjust signal timings accordingly.
- **Remote Control & Automation:** Allows centralized control of traffic signals via IoT.
- **Emergency Vehicle Priority:** Detects emergency vehicles and adjusts signals to prioritize them.
- **Adaptive Timing Algorithm:** Dynamically modifies signal durations based on traffic conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **IoT Components:** Sensors (IR/Ultrasonic), Arduino, NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32)
- **Programming Languages:** C++ (Arduino)
- **Cloud & Connectivity:** Arduino IoT Cloud
- **Frontend & Dashboard:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Sensors detect vehicle density at intersections.
2. **Processing:** The microcontroller processes data and sends it to the cloud.
3. **Decision Making:** The backend processes the data and dynamically adjusts the traffic signals.
4. **Visualization:** A web dashboard provides real-time monitoring and control.

## Future Enhancements
- AI-based predictive traffic control using machine learning.
- Integration with Google Maps for real-time traffic updates.
- Mobile application for remote monitoring and management.
